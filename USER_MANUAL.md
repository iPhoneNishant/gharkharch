## Using the App

### Understanding Double-Entry Accounting

Gharkharch uses **double-entry accounting**, which means every transaction affects two accounts:
- **Debit Account**: The account receiving value (money coming in)
- **Credit Account**: The account giving value (money going out)

This ensures your books always balance and provides accurate financial tracking.

### Account Types

The app supports four types of accounts:

| Type | Description | Examples |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Asset** | Things you own | Bank accounts, Cash, Investments |
| **Liability** | Things you owe | Credit cards, Loans, Mortgages |
| **Income** | Money you earn | Salary, Freelance income, Interest |
| **Expense** | Money you spend | Rent, Groceries, Utilities, Entertainment |

## PIN Authentication

### What is PIN Authentication?

PIN authentication is a security feature that requires you to enter a 4-6 digit PIN code every time you open the app. This ensures that only you can access your financial data.

### How PIN Authentication Works

1. **On App Launch**
   - When you open the app, you'll see the PIN verification screen
   - If biometric authentication is enabled, it will be attempted first automatically
   - If biometric fails or is not available, you'll be prompted to enter your PIN

2. **Entering Your PIN**
   - Enter your 4-6 digit PIN using the on-screen keypad
   - Tap "Continue" to verify your PIN
   - If correct, you'll be taken to the main app screen

3. **PIN Requirements**
   - PIN must be 4-6 digits long
   - Only numeric digits (0-9) are allowed
   - Choose a PIN that's easy for you to remember but hard for others to guess

### Important Notes

- **New PIN on Every Login**: For security, you'll need to set up a new PIN every time you log in with your email and password. Your previous PIN will be cleared.
- **PIN Persistence**: Once you set up a PIN, it remains active until you log out or set up a new one after logging in again.
- **Cannot Skip**: PIN setup cannot be skipped - it's required for app security.

## Biometric Authentication

### What is Biometric Authentication?

Biometric authentication uses your device's built-in security features (Face ID, Touch ID, or Fingerprint) to verify your identity instead of entering a PIN.

### Supported Biometric Methods

- **Face ID** (iPhone X and later)
- **Touch ID** (iPhone 6s to iPhone 8, iPad with Touch ID)
- **Fingerprint** (Android devices with fingerprint sensors)

### Enabling Biometric Authentication

1. **During PIN Setup**
   - After setting up your PIN, if your device supports biometrics, you'll see an option to enable it
   - Tap "Enable Biometric Authentication"
   - Follow your device's prompts to complete the setup

2. **From Settings**
   - Go to Settings in the app
   - Navigate to "Security" or "PIN Settings"
   - Toggle on "Biometric Authentication"
   - Follow the on-screen prompts

### How Biometric Authentication Works

1. **Automatic Attempt**
   - When you open the app, biometric authentication is attempted first automatically
   - You'll see a loading indicator while the system processes your biometric
   - If successful, you'll be taken directly to the main app screen

2. **Fallback to PIN**
   - If biometric authentication fails or is cancelled, you can use your PIN instead
   - The PIN input screen will appear automatically
   - You can also tap "Use [Biometric Type] instead" to try biometric again

### Disabling Biometric Authentication

1. Go to Settings in the app
2. Navigate to "Security" or "PIN Settings"
3. Toggle off "Biometric Authentication"
4. You'll now need to use your PIN for authentication

## Security Features

### Automatic Logout After Failed Attempts

For your security, the app will automatically log you out if you enter an incorrect PIN 5 times in a row.

**What Happens:**
- After 5 failed PIN attempts, you'll see an alert message
- You'll be automatically logged out of your account
- Your PIN will be cleared
- You'll need to log in again with your email and password
- You'll need to set up a new PIN after logging in

**Why This Feature Exists:**
- Protects your account from unauthorized access attempts
- Ensures your financial data remains secure
- Prevents brute-force attacks on your PIN

### Attempt Counter

- The app shows you how many attempts you have remaining
- After each failed attempt, the counter decreases
- Example: "4 attempts remaining", "3 attempts remaining", etc.
- The counter resets only after successful verification or logout

### Back Button Protection

- On the PIN setup and verification screens, the back button is disabled
- This prevents accidentally skipping security steps
- You must complete PIN setup or verification to proceed

---

## Managing Your PIN

### Changing Your PIN

1. Go to Settings in the app
2. Navigate to "Security" or "PIN Settings"
3. Tap "Change PIN"
4. Enter your current PIN to verify
5. Enter your new PIN (4-6 digits)
6. Confirm your new PIN
7. Your PIN has been successfully changed

### Resetting Your PIN

If you've forgotten your PIN:

1. **Log Out and Log Back In**
   - Go to Settings
   - Tap "Sign Out"
   - Log in again with your email and password
   - You'll be prompted to set up a new PIN

2. **After 5 Failed Attempts**
   - If you enter the wrong PIN 5 times, you'll be automatically logged out
   - Log in again and set up a new PIN

**Note:** There is no "Forgot PIN" option because your PIN is stored securely on your device. If you can't remember it, logging out and back in will allow you to set a new one.

## Troubleshooting

### Biometric Authentication Not Working

**Problem:** Biometric authentication isn't working or not available.

**Solutions:**
1. **Check Device Support**
   - Ensure your device supports biometric authentication
   - Check if Face ID/Touch ID/Fingerprint is set up in your device settings

2. **Enable in Device Settings**
   - Go to your device's Settings
   - Set up Face ID, Touch ID, or Fingerprint if not already done
   - Return to the app and try again

3. **Use PIN Instead**
   - If biometric continues to fail, use your PIN to access the app
   - You can try enabling biometric again later from Settings

### PIN Not Working

**Problem:** Your PIN isn't being accepted even though you're sure it's correct.

**Solutions:**
1. **Check for Typos**
   - Make sure you're entering the correct PIN
   - Double-check each digit as you type

2. **Recent Login**
   - If you recently logged in, remember that a new PIN is required
   - Your old PIN was cleared when you logged in

3. **Log Out and Set New PIN**
   - If you're certain about your PIN but it's not working, log out
   - Log back in and set up a new PIN

### App Asking for PIN Setup Again

**Problem:** The app keeps asking you to set up a PIN even though you already did.

**Possible Causes:**
1. **You Logged Out**
   - If you signed out, your PIN was cleared for security
   - This is normal behavior - set up a new PIN after logging in

2. **App Restart**
   - If you killed the app and reopened it, your PIN should still work
   - If it's asking for setup, you may have been logged out

3. **After 5 Failed Attempts**
   - If you entered the wrong PIN 5 times, you were logged out
   - Log back in and set up a new PIN

### Can't Access App

**Problem:** You're locked out of the app.

**Solutions:**
1. **Try Your PIN**
   - Make sure you're entering the correct PIN
   - Check the attempt counter to see how many tries you have left

2. **Wait After Failed Attempts**
   - If you've had multiple failed attempts, wait a moment before trying again
   - The app may need a moment to process

3. **Log Out and Log Back In**
   - If you're completely locked out, you may need to log out
   - However, you'll need to enter your PIN correctly first, or wait for automatic logout after 5 failed attempts
   - Then log back in with your email and password

---

## FAQs

### Q: Why do I need to set up a PIN every time I log in?

**A:** This is a security feature. When you log in with your email and password, your previous PIN is cleared for security reasons. You'll need to set up a new PIN each time you log in. However, if you just close and reopen the app (without logging out), your PIN will still work.

### Q: Can I use the same PIN every time?

**A:** Yes, you can choose to use the same PIN each time you set it up. The app doesn't remember your previous PIN, but you can manually enter the same PIN when setting it up again.

### Q: What happens if I forget my PIN?

**A:** If you forget your PIN, you have two options:
1. Enter the wrong PIN 5 times to trigger automatic logout, then log back in and set a new PIN
2. If you're already logged in, go to Settings and sign out, then log back in to set a new PIN

### Q: Can I disable PIN authentication?

**A:** No, PIN authentication is required for security. It cannot be disabled. This ensures your financial data is always protected.

### Q: Why is biometric authentication attempted first?

**A:** Biometric authentication is faster and more convenient than entering a PIN. The app tries it first automatically. If it fails or is not available, you can use your PIN instead.

### Q: What if my device doesn't support biometrics?

**A:** That's perfectly fine! You can still use the app with PIN authentication. Biometric authentication is optional and only available on devices that support it.

### Q: Is my PIN stored securely?

**A:** Yes, your PIN is stored securely on your device using encrypted storage. It's never transmitted over the network or stored on servers.

### Q: Can someone else access my app if they have my device?

**A:** No, they would need either:
- Your biometric (Face ID, Touch ID, or Fingerprint), OR
- Your PIN code

Without one of these, they cannot access the app, even if they have your device.

### Q: What happens if I uninstall the app?

**A:** If you uninstall the app, all local data including your PIN will be deleted. When you reinstall and log in, you'll need to set up a new PIN.

### Q: Can I use the app offline?

**A:** Yes, the app works offline. However, you'll still need to verify your PIN or use biometric authentication to access the app, even when offline.
